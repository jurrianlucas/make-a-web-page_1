        <h1>Stage Zero - The Basics</h1>
        <h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
        <p>The world wide is made of a lot of computers communicating with eachother. If you visit a webpage what actually happens is that your computer sends an <em>HTTP request</em> to a server. The server finds the HTML document and sends it to your computer where the browsers <em>if everything goes well</em> displays the website on your computer.</p>
        <h2>HTML Coding Basics</h2>
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for <em>Hyptertext Markup Language</em>. The majority of the content of the web are HTML documents. The HTML documents contain first of all <em>text content</em>. This describes "what you see". Secondly, HTML documents contain so-called <em>mark up</em>. This describes "how it looks". Additional languages and techniques can be used for advanced applications. The basis however is HTML. On <a href="www.wikipedia.nl">Wikipedia</a> you can find more information about HTML.
        <h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
        <p>HTML is made of elements or lines of code. We tell the computer what type of element it is by using tags. A tag is distinguished from a normal text by using the opening tag and the closing tag. Should you accidentaly forget to use the tags, the browser will not recognize it as such and the result on your screen is not what you expected. On the <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity website</a> they tell you much more about it.</p>
        <p>Examples of tags are for example the b-tag for <b>bold</b> and the em-tag for <em>italics</em>.
        <h3>Attributes</h3>
        <p>Attributes can be used inside of an element to give it more instructions and or information about it. Attributes will always start with a name and followed by a <em>value</em>. An example is the so-called anchor tag that is used to create a hyper link on a web page.</p>
        <h3>Inline and Block Elements</h3>
        <p>Inline elements will only take the space that it needs to contain its content. <span style="color:purple">For example making this sentence purple.</span> Block elements create an invisbe box around around the context. The size of the block can be adjusted in width and height.
        <h2>The take away</h2>
        <p>Computers are stupid! You need to tell the computer exactly what to do. I think they call this writing the correct <em>syntax</em>.</p>

        <h1>Stage One</h1>
        <h2>The Structure of Design</h2>
        <p>With each line of code it is extremely important to maintain structure. Each element in HTML can have a other elements inside of it. You can draw this as a tree-like structure. A box has a box inside of it that has a box inside of it. It actually reminds me of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droste_effect">Droste effect</a>. A picture in a picture in a picture and so on.</p>
        <h2>Boxes!</h2>
        <p>Although it may not look like it, a website is nothing else than some rectangles and boxes. You can modify them through <b>CSS</b> to make them look differently. An important tag in order to organize this is the <em>div</em> tag. Creating a class for your div tag will help you to maintain structure and .</p>

        <h1>Stage Two - CSS</h1>
        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>. An important element is inheritance. This prevents certain properties from being declared over and over again in a style sheet allowing to write less code. It enhances faster loading of webpages.</p>
        <h2>How does this work?</h2>
        <p>If you want to write CSS that makes all h1 elements have a blue background and white letters, you could ... well you can actually check the CSS code of this page!</p>
        <h2>Selecting by class</h2>
        <p>If we want to add style to <em>certain</em> h1's we can use <b>class selectors</b>. So we can apply rules to <b>all</b> div's or just <em>certain</em> div's by using the appropriate selector.
